A quick project to build [BulmaCSS](https://bulma.io/)

Many of the examples here are directly from the Bulma documentation site! I copied them over
so I can see the affect of changing the Sass variables and other variables adjustments.


## How to build CSS

```
npm install
npm run build
```

## How to view the examples

```
npx http-server
open http://127.0.0.1:8080/
open http://127.0.0.1:8080/components/
open http://127.0.0.1:8080/layout/
```
